To run this example using PRO as the underlying search algorithm,
first make sure the parameters in the pro_init_generic.tcl (in
<harmony_dir>/tcl/pro/) are defined properly. Most important ones are
the space_dimension and npoints parameters. space_dimension for this
example should be 2 (since we have two tunable parameters) and the
npoints parameter should be set to how many copies of this example you
want to run simultaneoualy. To run eight copies (which means the
simplex size will be 8), set the npoints parameter to 8.

To run eight copies of the example: (in bash)

    for i in $(seq 1 1 8); do ./example & done
