This file contains a description of the files that are comprised in this
directory. It has a short description of each file, but it does not
get into details of implementation, as this is (or should be!) done in
each file.

* ===================
* Directory Structure
* ===================

build/       : source files
code-server/ : CHiLL-based code generation server
doc/         : documentation
example/     : several demo examples
WIP/         : Works in progress

* ================
* Building Harmony
* ================

In general, the following command should suffice to build the entire
framework, including examples:

	$ make

This make system is sensitive to additional build flags supplied by
the environment:

	$ make CFLAGS=-O3 LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib64

Use the "install" target to copy all binaries and supporting files
outside of their respective source directories:

	$ make install

By default, the Active Harmony framework is installed in the base
directory of the source tree.  Use the PREFIX environment variable to
override this:

	$ make install PREFIX=/usr/local

* =======================
* Notable Installed Files
* =======================

<PREFIX>/bin/hserver       - Harmony server
<PREFIX>/bin/tuna          - Harmony command-line tuning shell.
<PREFIX>/bin/harmony.cfg   - This is the global configuration file.  All
                             run-time customization such as code server
                             type, or search algorithm selection, should
                             be made in this file.
<PREFIX>/include/hclient.h - Prototypes of the Harmony Client API functions.
<PREFIX>/lib/libharmony.a  - Clients that use the Harmony API must link
                             against this archive.

* ==================
* Running An Example
* ==================

To run the server:
	$ ./hserver [configuration_file]

The HARMONY_CONFIG environment variable can also be used to specify which
configuration file to use.  For example:

	$ HARMONY_CONFIG=<some_other_dir>/harmony.cfg ./hserver

To build and run the example client:

	$ cd <SRCDIR>/example/client_api
	$ make

If the server is running and the environment is set up correctly,
running an example should be immediately executable.  For instance,
the C example may be run as follows:

	$ ./example_c

By default, the example will attempt to communicate with a Harmony
Server listening on localhost:1979, as this is the default host/port
pair for the Harmony Server.  If you wish to connect to a server
running on a different host or port, use the HARMONY_S_HOST or
HARMONY_S_PORT environment variables, respectively:

	$ export HARMONY_S_HOST=other.host.net
	$ export HARMONY_S_PORT=2013

A complex example is provided in <SRCDIR>/example/code_generation.
That example relies on our code-server, MPI, and CHiLL.  Additional
details can be found in <SRCDIR>/example/code_generation/README.
