These examples assume that we are running a sequential search algorithm (Nelder Mead Simplex, Random or Brute Force).

When running the harmony server, please make sure that the first command line argument for the hserver is either
2(Nelder Mead), 3 (Random) or 4 (Brute-force).

Should you change these to tune for code-sections that require code generation to move from one value to another, 
set the code_generation parameters in <algorithm>_init.tcl files appropriately.

To run these examples:

cd <example_directory>
gmake
./<example_executable>
