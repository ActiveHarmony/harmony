 * associated with a particular tuning session.  The functions within
 * this section allow the user to create and manage the resources
 * controlled by the descriptor.

/**
 * \brief Allocate and initialize a new Harmony descriptor.
 *
 * All client API functions require a valid Harmony descriptor to
 * function correctly.  The descriptor is designed to be used as an
 * opaque type and no guarantees are made about the contents of its
 * structure.
 *
 * Similar to MPI's initialization function mpi_init(), harmony_init()
 * optionally accepts the address of the two parameters to main
 * (`argc` and `argv`).  If provided, any string that resembles a
 * Harmony configuration directive will removed from argv and saved
 * elsewhere.  Scanning ends early if a `--` parameter is found.
 * These directives are then applied immediately prior to session
 * launch or client join, whichever comes first.
 *
 * Heap memory is allocated for the descriptor, so be sure to call
 * harmony_fini() when it is no longer needed.
 *
 * \param argc Address of argc parameter from main().
 * \param argv Address of argv parameter from main().
 *
 * \return Returns Harmony descriptor upon success, and `NULL` otherwise.
