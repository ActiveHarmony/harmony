These examples assume that we are running a sequential search algorithm.
Supported sequential search algorithms are Nelder Mead, Random, and Brute
Force.

When running the harmony server, please make sure its configuration file
(eg. harmony.cfg) specifies one of these sequential algorithms for the
"search_algorithm" directive.

Should you change these to tune for code-sections that require code
generation to move from one value to another, set the code_generation
parameters in <algorithm>_init.tcl files appropriately.

To run these examples:

	cd <example_directory>
	make
	./<example_executable>
