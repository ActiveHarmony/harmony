Introduction
============
This directory contains sample applications that use Active Harmony's
Client API to enable run-time auto-tuning support.  The same sample
application is written in multiple languages to provide a specific
example in each language we support.

Building
========
The build process will perform a check to ensure compilers exist
before attempting to build an example for any given language.  So, the
following command can be used to build all examples a system supports:

	$ make all

Specific examples can also be built by name.  Here is a list of valid
target binaries:

	example_c - C
	example_f - Fortran
	example_chpl - Chapel Parallel Programming Language

Running
=======
These binaries will attempt to connect to a Harmony server at launch
time.  The HARMONY_S_HOST and HARMONY_S_PORT environment variables can
be used to control where the client should find the server.

For example, to use the defaults (localhost:1977):

	$ example_c

To specify a different location:

	$ HARMONY_S_HOST=h.server.org HARMONY_S_PORT=2012 example_c
