This is an mpi based example.

Since the application here has six tunable parameters, the mpi application has to be run on at least
7 processors. Please make sure the parameters in pro_init_<appname>.tcl (in <harmony_dir>/tcl/pro/
directory) are defined appropriately.

space_dimension parameter in the init file has to be 6 and the npoints parameter in the init file
has to be at least 7 (no upper limit).
